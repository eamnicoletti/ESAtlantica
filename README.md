# ESAtlantica

Hello!

This is my final course project necessary for my approval in the graduation in Systems and Development Analyst at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Esp√≠rito Santo - IFES:

Application for sending reports of environmental crimes to the governmental authority responsible through geolocation, typification of crimes, photos and description of facts.
In addition, it has a very broad content of Brazilian environmental legislation to research.

All of this thinking about the degradation that the Atlantic Forest biome has been suffering in Brazil.

Building with C# in Visual Studio 2017 while using Xamarin and Xamarin Forms to be a cross-platform app.

Hope you enjoy!
